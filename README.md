Enhanced java enum for standards ISO 3166 (countries), ISO 4217 (currencies), ISO 639 (languages) + ISO18245 (Merchant Category Codes)

About:
------

I'm an Entrepreneur in Mobile Payment and because payment is very normative, I needed to create java enumerations for some of the standards in use by the payment Industry.

I did search for a while over Internet, but I did not find pieces of code that match my needs:
- comprehensive, crossreferencing and as far as possible accurate information;
- local names, I18N and contextualised display for use in mobile / web app I have designed (e.g. display the currency local symbol, the country local name...)

Hence this contribution. Free of charge/licence for both personal and commercial usages.

It took me hours, without saying days, compiling information and implementing these enums for my own product.
I guess it might be of some help for someone else (and not only for payment related projects), avoiding same tedious work (or limiting it, if it does fit your requirements).

Kind regards.

Notes:
------

Everything defined therein is in public domain (public access resources: wikipedia, RFC, international scheme public documentation); thus, it cannot contravene ISO policy (furthermore this contribution is for use in java programming, and ISO never publishes a single piece of code, AFAIK).

I'm overwhelmed by my own project and do not plan to maintain this contribution.

Please have a look to disclaimer on top of each java source.
